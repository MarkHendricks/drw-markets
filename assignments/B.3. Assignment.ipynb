    "Recall that in analyzing fixed income products, duration measures the percentage change of price with respect to a shift in rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dP}{P} = -D dr + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is duration is at the heart of much of the trading in fixed income.\n",
    "\n",
    "In equities, there is an analogous concept: a stock's **beta**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_t = \\alpha + \\beta r^{\\text{SPY}}_t + \\epsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This beta is analyzed with respect to many factors, but it is most widely analyzed with respect to the S&P 500 (or a similar, broad equity index. Thus the notation $r^{\\text{SPY}}_t$ on the right-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation\n",
    "For each ETF return series, estimate the regression above. (You will estimate many regressions, in a loop, each using SPY as the right-hand-side factor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Report these betas. Which ETF has the most overall stock-market risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hint: \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the regression, consider using the following approach:\n",

    "`from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`\n",

    "## 3 Factor Structure of Stocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the \"market\" (often meaning S&P500) beta so popular as a risk factor for equities? It is because, (like fixed income with rates,) there is a strong factor structure. That is, many stocks have a lot of correlation to the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this factor structure statistically, use `spx_returns_weekly.xlsx`, to do a principal component analysis (PCA) of S&P 500 returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 \n",
    "Calculate the variance explained by each PCA factor. List the top 5. How important is the first factor in explaining everything? Are the other factors important?\n",
